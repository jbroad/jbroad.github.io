<h2>Elections 2020: Arizona State Senate</h2>
<p2><br>Quick Overview:<br><br>
Some political observers (especially liberal observers) have bemoaned the lack of academic and strategic attention given to state and local politics.<br><br>
This post is one small step toward a larger project aiming to fill the gap in attention to state politics. This project will investigate the long-term strategic choices of national interest groups in Arizona state politics. <br><br>
Below is an interactive graphic allowing the user to explore Arizona's state legislative districts, its voter registration numbers, and the 2018 election outcomes for both the state House and Senate. Click on a legislative district on the map (left) to see more information about that district, including registration trends since 2012 (right).

<p2>Arizona state election outcomes can be predicted with nearly 100% accuracy with just one variable: the Democrat-Republican registration differential. The panel on the bottom right shows the trend of this differential since 2012. As the reader can see, very few districts are competitive; in all but two districts, the proportion of one party exceeds the proportion of the other by more than five points.<br><br>
If the 2020 election were to take place today, districts 8 (Frank Pratt - R) and 18 (Sean Bowie - D) would be highly competitive. The remaining 28 legislative districts would be highly likely to retain their current party representation. This is highly problematic for Democrats, as they need to pick up three seats and retain district 18 to gain a majority in the Senate. <br><br>
However, the registration trends above show sudden (and at times drastic) bumps and dips as national and state-wide campaign efforts get into gear. I will update this post soon to include registration forecasts going into the 2020 presidential election. Should the Democrats organize as successfully as they did in 2016, two additional districts may be within their grasp: districts 20 (Paul Boyer - R) and 28 (Kate Brophy McGee - R).<br><br>
That said, based on current registration trends, the most optimistic forecast may classify districts 20 and 28 as competitive, 18 from competitive to solid Republican, and 8 from competitive to solid Democrat. In this scenario, Democrats may actually have a shot at taking the Senate. Stay tuned for a more sophisticated prediction of 2020 election outcomes.
